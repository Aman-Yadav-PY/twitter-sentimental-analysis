# twitter-sentimental-analysis
Developed a Deep Neural Network for sentiment analysis of tweets, utilizing a TensorFlow sequential model to build the architecture. To accelerate the model training, I employed a CUDA-based training environment within a WSL container image in Docker. As a result, I achieved an F1 score of 0.835 and a cross-entropy loss of approximately 0.4.
